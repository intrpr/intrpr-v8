### Published Course Description and Prerequisites
In keeping with a January 2016 request from the University’s Department of Languages and Cultures, the original course description and prerequisites are listed below. Other than the obvious conversion of this course into an online-only asynchronous format, the above learning objectives for this course are expansions and clarifications of the original expectations:

“Prerequisites: ASL 3360, matriculation into the Interpreting Emphasis and University Advanced Standing 

Introduces skills and processes required to produce conceptually accurate and linguistically appropriate messages using ASL signs in an English word order. Develops cognitive, semantic, and dual tasking abilities required to interpret spontaneous texts. Teaches and incorporates more advanced semantic choices and negotiation techniques. Works with a variety of audience sizes and types. Teaches how ethics impact behavioral decisions and interpretations. Gives more consideration to developing sets of technical or field-specific signs and applying these to interpretative work. Includes one-hour per week lab. Lab access fee of $10 applies.”

As you know, this course requires your completely self-directed efforts (a/synchronously working with other colleagues) and fairly good command of web-based technologies and learning environments (video creation, salient discussion, and reporting skills).

This course requires a one-hour per week lab criteria; students should expect to spend at least an hour a week on skill-building exercises in a language laboratory setting.

* Failure to participate or submit assignments in class (in other words, if you stop participating) does not constitute withdrawal from the course; note the dates for dropping and adding courses from the university calendar. If circumstances make it impossible for you to complete this course, then you must officially withdraw. Otherwise, you may receive a grade at the end of the semester you did not intend.
* If you require accommodations because of a disability, contact the UVU Accessibility Services Department (ASD), located on the Orem Campus in LC 312. To schedule an appointment or to speak with a counselor, call the ASD office at (801) 863-8747. Deaf/hard-of-hearing students should coordinate any needed services with the instructor and the Accessibility Services Department.
