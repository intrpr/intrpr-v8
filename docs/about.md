## What’s going on here?
This site is intended to make my life a little simpler as an instructor (and contributing practitioner to the field). Let’s face it: a university education is difficult. It takes up an inordinate amount of time, and, while it is well worth it in the long run, a wee bit of organization certainly helps the cause.

### Holla.
Additionally, this site is intended to give back to my colleagues in the interpreting community to whom I am indebted. There is a liberal Creative Commons license covering materials available from this site; information and professional development should be open and sharable within our interpreting community. This license does not apply, however, to work claimed by other authors and producers. Additionally, every intent has been made to make materials available via “Fair Use,” (§107 to 118, Title 17, US Code); the content and downloadable materials on the pages of this Web site are solely for the benefit of the students enrolled in these courses. We’re all trying to get and be better in this field; put your money where your mouth is.

This site is also an experiment in simplicity. Users hate to be frustrated when they use websites, so I’ve tried to make every contingency that I could think of. I’m sure you, gentle reader, will find areas that can be improved and so I invite your feedback.

This entire site is standards-compliant; (for you gearheads) it is developed responsively in HTML5, CSS3, and is W3C compliant. Within the body of the site, there is not one — no, not one — tdbody, colspan, or icky Microsoft FrontPage line of code included. Thanks to the beauty of cascading style sheets, everything you see before you is text-based.

For those of you with iPhones, Android OS, and iPads, these sites will also display nicely on your devices (you might not have even noticed it; good for me). Resize your browser window or try your iPhone.

Almost every downloadable file — readings, articles, class notes, syllabi, and other handouts — are saved in PDF formats and require Adobe Acrobat Reader. (There are a few sample Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, or OpenOffice bibliography templates available for download on the class writing page.) If the computer you are using does not have Acrobat or the Acrobat browser plugin, you can download the free Reader application.

## About UVU’s Courses
Let’s take this opportunity to clear up some myths:

1. UVU has not, does not, nor does it plan to establish a full-blown interpreting training program, per se. There. It’s said. You can check with my boss on this one, but I’m pretty sure he’ll back me up.
2. As of the end of Fall Semester 2010, the ACIPP program has been discontinued. Please contact the Foreign Language office or Dr. Hoffman for more information about future UVU interpreting paracertificate programs.
3. As of Fall 2004, UVU does offer a minor in ASL and Deaf Studies.
4. And as of Fall 2007, UVU offers a bachelor’s degree in ASL and Deaf Studies. That’s fairly exciting, seeing that there are literally a handful of such programs offered in the United States and you get to come all the way to Utah to get your degree.
5. Read the class descriptions at the department ASL website or if you’re interested in learning how these courses are applied towards your degree, contact ASL Department Chair, Michael Ballard, mballard (at) uvu.edu.

## Contact Information
If you need to contact me, the best way is via email or text. If you absolutely must use the talkie phone, you may call my mobile phone — ask me for the number first. So email me at dstringham (at) gmail.com. Rest assured, I’m very responsive to e-mail so I’ll get your information one way or the other.

You can also schedule appointments with me on campus either before/after class.

## Colophon
This site is viewed optimally in all modern HTML5-compliant web and mobile/device browsers (except maybe Windows Internet Explorer which is 1) dangerous and susceptible to myriad security issues and 2) has continued to ignore standards compliancy; sorry if this causes any problems for you).

After binders and stacks of overhead transparencies started to become unwieldy, this site was originally worked out on paper and then brought to life in 2002 — fifteen years ago! — on an Apple Macintosh G5 using Macromedia Dreamweaver, TextMate, and TextWrangler. The site is now in its fourth version, rapidly built on the Twitter Bootstrap 3.x framework and maintained with Atom on several different computers and devices (but mostly on a 15" 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 MacBook Pro). Typefaces used are Libre Franklin by Pablo Impallari and Poppins by Ninad Kale and both are hosted at Google Fonts.

A note on privacy: I don’t (read: can’t) collect or store any information about users so you can breathe a little easier.

## My background/vitae
I have been an adjunct instructor in the ASL & Deaf Studies department at Utah Valley University since 1995. I teach a variety of signed language interpreting courses, including an introduction to the field, cross-cultural considerations in interpreting, and consecutive and simultaneous bidirectional interpretation/transliteration. My academic interests are in interpreter education, nineteenth-century Deaf history, history and etymology of signed languages, visual and graphical representations of signed language, and enhancing teaching opportunities with technology.
