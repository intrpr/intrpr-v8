# Ethics for Interpreters <small>(ASL4370)</small>

{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Course description and learning objectives

This online-only course is an introduction to and an exploration of ethical-based reasoning and decision making in professional signed language (SL) events. Instructor/student interaction will be in both ASL and [written English](http://www.hemingwayapp.com). Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to demonstrate they can:

1. **describe** basic relevant historical ethical and moral philosophies and identify how deontological and teleological principles impact decision making in professional interpreting events
2. **rapidly assess** potential ethical concerns in a variety of interpreting events — community, educational, legal, medical and mental health settings — using a framework of critical thinking, professional codes of conduct, and ethical-based reasoning
	* also **demonstrate** collaboration with team members and professional colleagues in better understanding various applications of ethical thinking and problem-solving
3. accurately **remember** and **apply** guiding ethical principles and tenets found in both the Code of Professional Conduct of the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID, 1998) and Demand-Control Schema (Dean & Pollard, 2013)
4. **apply** problem-based learning principles, understanding of professional codes of conduct, and ethical-based reasoning to interpreting events in which participants demonstrate atypical language ([CALI, Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/cali/unfolding-scenarios), 2019)

This course is intended to help prepare candidates to demonstrate ethical decision making competence on the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf [Ethics and Cultural Responsiveness component of the NIC/CASLI Generalist Knowledge examination](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AlRkI8vhwQrOwlX12e_5Rsxh8vgqHmUN/view) or [Utah State Certification](https://jobs.utah.gov/usor/uip/certification/index.html) Exams.

A significant portion of this course requires self-directed efforts (a/sychronously working with other colleagues) and fairly good command of web-based technologies and learning environments (video creation, salient discussion and reporting skills; we’ll discuss this more in class).

This course requires a one-hour per week lab criteria; students should expect to spend at least an hour a week on skill-building exercises in a language laboratory setting.
