### Published Course Description and Prerequisites
In keeping with a January 2016 request from the University’s Department of Languages and Cultures, the original course description and prerequisites are listed below. Other than the obvious conversion of this course into an online-only asynchronous format, the above learning objectives for this course are expansions and clarifications of the original expectations:

“Prerequisites: ASL 3360, matriculation into the Interpreting Emphasis and University Advanced Standing 

> Introduces skills and processes required to produce conceptually accurate and linguistically appropriate messages using ASL signs in an English word order. Develops cognitive, semantic, and dual tasking abilities required to interpret spontaneous texts. Teaches and incorporates more advanced semantic choices and negotiation techniques. Works with a variety of audience sizes and types. Teaches how ethics impact behavioral decisions and interpretations. Gives more consideration to developing sets of technical or field-specific signs and applying these to interpretative work. Includes one-hour per week lab. Lab access fee of $10 applies.”

As you know, this course requires your completely self-directed efforts (a/synchronously working with other colleagues) and fairly good command of web-based technologies and learning environments (video creation, salient discussion, and reporting skills).

This course requires a one-hour per week lab criteria; students should expect to spend at least an hour a week on skill-building exercises in a language laboratory setting.

### Inclusion and appreciation

*“Come as you are. UVU has a place for you.” — President Tuminez*

Your experience in this class is important to me, and this experience is intended to be inclusive and equitable and foster a safe and successful learning environment. In this class, we not only acknowledge the differences and diversity — gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture — of the peoples we’ll study, but also as a strength of what you individually bring to this class. Please contact me if you would like to talk about any suggestions and/or concerns. If that feels uncomfortable, you can also contact the [Inclusion and Diversity Committee](https://www.uvu.edu/inclusion/about) to ask for help and support.

Or, if you have concerns about something that occurs (or doesn't occur) in class, I hope you'll feel comfortable enough to discuss it with me. If we cannot find reasonable ground between us, you may consider making an appointment with Dr. Ballard (8016699463 VP or mballard (at) uvu.edu).

### How is my work evaluated? (or, in other words, “How do I get an A?”)

Course final grades are determined by combining:

* honestly-earned scores on all of the submitted assignments and quizzes
* your performance as committed on your student-teacher contract
* in-course participation

While there is some assessment for specific factual who-what-when information in this course, assignments and quizzes are designed to identify how well you can internalize principles and knowledge, and then apply them to create solutions to various situations (‘applying’ and ‘analyzing’ skills).

Although obviously there are spaces for personal opinion within discussion posts and responses, you should more often look for opportunities to demonstrate your knowledge about a particular topic or question instead of contributing superficial commentary (“I agree with what A says...” or “I think B is really neat because...”) to the discussion. It's perfectly fine to disagree with other cohorts too — that shows [critical thinking depth and abilities](https://www.rasmussen.edu/student-experience/college-life/critical-thinking-skills-to-master-now) — and cite evidence and data from our texts as you answer questions.

Scoring criteria are clearly defined in stated rubrics and scales; you should understand what you need to do to earn the grade you want. Ultimately, your grade is a reflection of your personal effort and internalization of concepts learned in the course.

### Assignments breakdown
There are no papers required for this course, however, assignments and assessments are tailored to measure your knowledge and applications of ethical-based reasoning. A significant portion of your grade is dependent on well-reasoned, well-researched, and accurate demonstrations of your ability to apply ethical-based reasoning.

| Assignment   | Qty  | Points each  | Points total | % of grade |
|:-------------|:-----|:-------------|:-------------|:-----------|
| ok           | 1    | 10           | 10           | 1%         |

### Student success resources and dealing with COVID-19
We're still in a difficult phase of cautious engagement as we continue to deal with the impact of COVID-19 in our learning spaces. Unfortunately, you are more familiar now at navigating a pandemic than you were last semester, but regardless, I want to help you be as successful as you can.

First and foremost, **please practice self care**. If you have high-risk tendencies, typically get a mid-semester 'school cold,' or become a no-sleep hero when school starts, please reconsider your daily routine. Be aware of your physical state and seek preemptive testing if you're concerned. If you contact me if your health condition changes, we can work together on assignment submission.

### Attendance policies and students with disabilities
* Failure to participate or submit assignments in class (in other words, if you stop participating) does not constitute withdrawal from the course; note the dates for dropping and adding courses from the university calendar. If circumstances make it impossible for you to complete this course, then you must officially withdraw. Otherwise, you may receive a grade at the end of the semester you did not intend.
* If you require accommodations because of a disability, contact the UVU Accessibility Services Department (ASD), located on the Orem Campus in LC 312. To schedule an appointment or to speak with a counselor, call the ASD office at (801) 863-8747. Deaf/hard-of-hearing students should coordinate any needed services with the instructor and the Accessibility Services Department.
